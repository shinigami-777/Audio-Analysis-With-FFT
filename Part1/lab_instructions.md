# Laboratory Manual: Signal Processing and Fourier Transform Analysis

## Objective
To explore fundamental signal processing concepts through the implementation of the
Continuous-Time Fourier Transform (CTFT) and various signal manipulation techniques,
using audio signals as practical examples.

## Theoretical Background

### The Continuous-Time Fourier Transform
X(j2πf) = ∫ x(t)e^(-j2πft)dt

This transform converts signals between time and frequency domains, enabling various
forms of analysis and manipulation.

## Implementation Guide

### Required Libraries
- numpy (for numerical computations)
- scipy.io.wavfile (for audio file handling)
- matplotlib.pyplot (for visualization)
- IPython.display (for audio playback)

## Signal Loading and Analysis

### Audio File Handling

1. Load the WAV file using scipy.io.wavfile
2. Handle these cases:
- Stereo to mono conversion
- Data type normalization
- Signal duration extraction

Pseudo-code structure:
```python
def prepare_audio(filename, duration, start_time):
# 1. Load audio file
# 2. Check if stereo -> convert to mono if needed
# 3. Extract segment of specified duration
# 4. Normalize signal to range [-1, 1]
# 5. Create time array
return time_array, sample_rate
```

### 1. Core CTFT Implementation

```python
def manual_ctft(signal, time_array, frequencies):
"""
Implement CTFT from first principles
"""
# 1. Set up integration parameters

# 2. For each frequency point:
# - Generate complex exponential
# - Multiply with signal
# - Integrate over time
return frequency_spectrum
```

Key Considerations:
- Time step size affects integration accuracy
- Complex number handling is essential
- Vectorization can improve performance

### 2. Time Reversal Analysis

```python
def analyze_time_reversal(signal):
"""
Compare time and frequency domain approaches
"""
# Method 1: Time Domain
# 1. Reverse signal directly
# 2. Calculate spectrum

# Method 2: Frequency Domain
# 1. Calculate original spectrum
# 2. Take complex conjugate

return time_method_results, freq_method_results
```

Expected Observations:
- Time reversal symmetry
- Spectrum magnitude preservation
- Phase conjugation effects

### 3. Signal Differentiation

```python
def analyze_differentiation(signal):
"""
Implement and compare differentiation methods
"""
# Time Domain Approach:
# 1. Calculate numerical gradient
# 2. Compute spectrum

# Frequency Domain Approach:
# 1. Transform signal
# 2. Multiply by j2πf

return derivative_results
```

Important Points:
- Numerical vs. analytical derivatives
- High-frequency emphasis
- Error propagation considerations

### 4. Energy Distribution Analysis

```python
def analyze_energy_distribution(signal, carrier_freq):
"""
Study signal modulation with high-frequency carrier
"""
# 1. Generate carrier wave
# 2. Apply modulation
# 3. Analyze spectrum
# 4. Create zoomed views

return modulated_signal, spectrum
```

Parameters to Consider:
- Carrier frequency selection (500 kHz)
- Modulation index effects
- Time window selection for visualization

### 5. Phase Pattern Analysis

```python
def analyze_phase_patterns(signal, carrier_freq):
"""
Investigate phase modulation effects
"""
# 1. Set up carrier (100 MHz)
# 2. Calculate phase terms
# 3. Apply modulation
# 4. Analyze results

return modulated_signal, spectrum
```

Key Aspects:
- Ultra-high frequency considerations
- Phase relationship preservation
- Modulation depth effects
